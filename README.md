## Project Overview

This was my first project on the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. It was done as a solo-effort over the course of 8 days and was my first chance at both building a game using JavaScript and at creating a project from scratch.

The game is based around the logic from the arcade classic, Space Invaders, where a swarm of aliens move down the grid row by row. The player is tasked with destroying as many of the aliens as possible before they reach the bottom of the grid, whilst also avoiding their bombs.

Being a huge fan of the ridiculous action-epic Face/Off, featuring Nick Cage and John Travolta, I smelt a perfect opportunity for a mash-up theme, this time with evil Castor Troy defending the airport hangar from the waves of cops swarming around him.
